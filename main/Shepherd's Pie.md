5. Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat oil. Add beef; season with 2 teaspoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.
6. Break up beef with a wooden spoon and cook until crumbled and no longer pink, 6 to 8 minutes.

11. Cook, stirring, until tomato paste turns dark red, 3 to 4 minutes.

13. Stir in broth and Worcestershire and bring to a simmer.
14. Sprinkle with flour and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir in corn and peas.
15. Pour beef mixture into a 13" x 9" pan and dollop mashed potatoes on top.
16. Lightly spray a rubber spatula with cooking spray and spread potatoes over beef mixture.
17. Sprinkle with Parmesan; season with a pinch of pepper.
