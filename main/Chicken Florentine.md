Servings: 6
Prep time: 5 min.
Cook time: 40 min.
Total time: 45 min.

## Indredients:
- 1/2 c. all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. kosher salt
- 1 tsp. garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp. ground black pepper
- 6 boneless skinless chicken thighs
- 4 tbsp. unsalted butter
- 2 tbsp. canola or vegetable oil
- 2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
- 2/3 c. dry white wine
- 1/3 c. chicken broth
- 1 c. heavy whipping cream
- 3 c. spinach, loosely packed
- 1/2 c. grated parmesan cheese
- 1/4 c. sliced sun-dried tomatoes, drained

## Instructions:
1. Combine the flour, salt, garlic powder, and pepper in a gallon-sized zip-top bag. Remove 1 tablespoon of the flour mixture and set aside.
3. Add the chicken thighs and seal the bag. Gently shake until the chicken is completely coated. Let the chicken sit in the flour mixture, at room temperature for 15 minutes. 
4. Melt the butter and oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once the butter mixture is bubbling, add the chicken thighs. Cook until golden brown and a food thermometer registers 165Â° in the thickest portion of the meat, about 6 to 7 minutes on each side.
5. Remove the chicken and place on a paper towel lined plate or wire rack. Remove all but about 1 tablespoon of drippings from the skillet. 
6. Add the garlic and cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add the reserved tablespoon of flour mixture to skillet.
7. Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes. Whisk in the wine, broth, and cream. Cook, stirring occasionally, until mixture is thickened, about 5 to 8 minutes.
8. Add the spinach and cook until wilted, about 3 to 4 minutes. Remove from the heat. 
9. Stir in the parmesan and sun-dried tomatoes. Return the chicken to pan just before serving.
