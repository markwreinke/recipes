## Indredients:
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 cup cornmeal
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- 3 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 2 large eggs room temperature
- 1 cup buttermilk or soured milk, see notes
- ⅓ cup butter melted

## Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease an 8×8-inch baking pan.
2. In a large bowl, combine flour, cornmeal, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.
3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, buttermilk, and melted butter.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.
5. Pour the mixture into the prepared pan.
6. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

## Notes:
- Buttermilk substitute: Buttermilk adds flavor as well as helps this cornbread recipe rise nicely. If you don’t have buttermilk, place 1 tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar in a 1 cup measuring cup. Fill to 1 cup with milk and stir. Let rest 5 minutes and use in place of buttermilk.
- Optional Additions: Add 1 cup corn kernels, 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese, or 1 finely diced jalapeno pepper to the batter before baking.
- Cornbread is great served with honey butter or for dipping into soups, stew, or chili.
